# JS to TS Workshop

This is the starter code for our workshop.  
Your task is to convert this simple Todo app from **JavaScript** to **TypeScript**.

### Steps:
1. Fork this repo to your GitHub account.
2. Clone your fork locally.
3. Create a new file `todo.ts`.
4. Convert the code:
   - Add types to variables and functions.
   - Create a `Todo` type.
   - Make sure everything compiles with TypeScript.
5. Run `tsc` to check your work.
